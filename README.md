## Learn More About This App
This App is a Shazam clone intended to implement key features of the Shazam app which is mainly identification of played songs
But this app is limited in resources and being just a personal project work did not bother to upgrade
Due to limited resources, this app can only identify certain 10 songs which you will find in the app's home page
